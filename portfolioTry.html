            <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A mindset is a belief that orients the way we handle situations—the way we sort out what is going on and what we should do.
                According to Gary Klein Ph.D. "A mindset is a belief that orients the way we handle situations; the way we sort out what is going
                on and what we should do. Our mindsets help us spot opportunities, but they can also trap us in self-defeating cycles."
                
                By learning what is the best mindset for ourselves we understand how it is important in our daily and out of ordinary situations.
                To have the right mindset is to have a kind of plan of how things should go in certain important situations in our lives.
                Tony Robins (American author, coach, speaker, and philanthropist) reminds us, "No one likes to fail, but it’s
                 a part of life, especially for high achievers. Creating a growth mindset doesn’t mean
                that you never fail. It means that you treat failure as a stepping stone to greater things.
                At the beginning of our journey we would think "I am a perfect God's creation why should i change myself? But I believe in power
                of good changes in life.
                Kaizen is a Japanese term meaning "change for the better" or "continuous improvement." It is a Japanese business philosophy
                regarding the processes that continuously improve operations and involve all employees. Tony Robins has his own translation:
                CANI! – Constant And Never-ending Improvement.

    <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp "Success is 5% Strategy and 95% Mindset." - Bob Proctor.
        It is always easier to say, 'I am just not able to do it'. It is so rewarding after you actually try and succeed afterwards.
        Programmers actually like to think that there is never one big problem. Usually, there are a lot of small issues becoming one.
        If we keep eliminating small issues we solve The Problem. Lithuanian proverb even says, that small dropd of rain water can end up breaking the stone:
        "Drop by drop and break the stone."
        In "Rich Dad Poor Dad"
        book by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, they talk about two fathers and how different their mindsets are.
        One of the dads instead of saying 'i can not do it' will ask himself: How can i do it?
        The Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (ISPCC-  national child protection charity in Ireland) provide a range of services to children and families.
        And in one of their programs called "SilverCloud" where they are
        teaching kids with anxiety to break problems into small manageable issues, which they would be able to overcome.
        Or achieving goals- if we would manage to break our goal into small manageable steps, it wouldn't sound so impossible.
